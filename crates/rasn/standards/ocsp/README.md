# Online Certificate Status Protocol
This crate provides an implementation of the data types for [RFC 6960], also
known as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).

Like other `rasn` core crates, this doesn't provide a OCSP client or server
but provides the core data types used to be able to create your own clients
and servers.
